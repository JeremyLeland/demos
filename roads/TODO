Automatically break up and link roads at intersections
  - Did it manually for now


Someday:
  - Replace zoom and scroll with bounds array [ left, top, right, bottom ]
    - Change bounds in once place instead of several scroll and zoom calls
    - Adjust function to zoom, add functions to translate

  - Draw gray road lines before direction arrows
    - Maybe this will take care of intersections for us
    - We can add detail later with the lane markers


Define "roads" as logical, named roadways. 
Automatically figure out intersections with other roads.
Build routes from that, which include arcs to turn at intersections.
Take into account lanes.

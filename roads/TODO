Automatically break up and link roads at intersections
  - Did it manually for now


Someday:
  - Replace zoom and scroll with bounds array [ left, top, right, bottom ]
    - Change bounds in once place instead of several scroll and zoom calls
    - Adjust function to zoom, add functions to translate

  - Draw gray road lines before direction arrows
    - Maybe this will take care of intersections for us
    - We can add detail later with the lane markers


Define "roads" as logical, named roadways. 
Automatically figure out intersections with other roads.
Build routes from that, which include arcs to turn at intersections.
Take into account lanes.


Elipses instead of arcs? Elipse length? Elipse join between lines?
  - Elipses lose the power of arcs, they end up being like quadratic beziers
  - Can't stack or easily get length without integrating
  - See if I can stick with lines and arcs for now (use combined line and arc for long turns)

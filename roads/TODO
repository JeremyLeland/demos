NEXT:
- Reworking deltaAngle and isBetweenAngles to better account for counterclockwise
  - Make tests so I can truly understand what these are doing
  - Thread-pulling from trying to pick proper middle point when moving start/end points past Math.PI distance from each other
- Redo intersections as list of affected routes and start/stop distances (instead of paths of tiny routes)

  - 2 way, 3 way, and 4 way intersections with lines
    - If it can't find intersections, then gracefully cancel creation. Maybe that will do it?

  - Two circles "venn diagram" style with a horizontal line between them
    - 3-way and 4-way intersections with line and arc

- 4-way stop
  - Simulate by quickly rotating short windows for each direction and specify yield?
    - Yield should keep them from crashing
    - Quickly rotating windows should prevent the same lane from going multiple times if someone else is waiting

- Intersections involving arcs
  - Arc vs Line
  - Arc vs Arc


Automatic intersections between arbitrary lines is hard. 
What if I did more like a train set, predefined acceptable intersections and pieces and linked them together?

- Splitting and merging lanes
  - e.g. splitting to add a left turn lane
  - Change streets to have lane info as part of start and end:
    street: {
      start: {
        pos: [ x, y ],
        lanes: {
          left: 1,
          right: 2,
        },
      },
      end: {
        pos: [ x, y ],
        lanes: {
          left: 2,
          right: 2,
        },
      },
    }
  - Longer, but I think it's the clearest way to save this info

Someday might want to just do lots of short lines (e.g. from bezier curve), but I like the simplicity of lines and arcs for now

- Automatically link streets that share endpoints
  - Would need to check generated start/end points against other streets and figure out if they are in line
  - Maybe this is part of the intersection work...
    - cases where streets need arcs to join, but there is no intersection
    - cases where streets can directly link (inline)

Instead of paths, intersections will be a set of routes with optional start and end distances

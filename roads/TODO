  - Replace zoom and scroll with bounds array [ left, top, right, bottom ]
    - Change bounds in once place instead of several scroll and zoom calls
    - Adjust function to zoom, add functions to translate

  - Draw gray road lines before direction arrows
    - Maybe this will take care of intersections for us
    - We can add detail later with the lane markers

  - Do a separate test for bezier drawing
    - Draw with uniform steps
    - Draw with steps based on tangent?
    - Approximate distance based on table

- Intersections of non-perpendicular lines
  - Can we still get nice arcs for these? Or will they be all screwed up?
  - Don't trim intersections as much if they aren't right angle
    - Make dependent on angle somehow

- 4-way stop
  - Simulate by quickly rotating short windows for each direction and specify yield?
    - Yield should keep them from crashing
    - Quickly rotating windows should prevent the same lane from going multiple times if someone else is waiting

- Intersections involving arcs
  - Arc vs Line
  - Arc vs Arc


Automatic intersections between arbitrary lines is hard. 
What if I did more like a train set, predefined acceptable intersections and pieces and linked them together?

- Splitting and merging lanes
  - e.g. splitting to add a left turn lane
  - Change streets to have lane info as part of start and end:
    street: {
      start: {
        pos: [ x, y ],
        lanes: {
          left: 1,
          right: 2,
        },
      },
      end: {
        pos: [ x, y ],
        lanes: {
          left: 2,
          right: 2,
        },
      },
    }
  - Longer, but I think it's the clearest way to save this info

Someday might want to just do lots of short lines (e.g. from bezier curve), but I like the simplicity of lines and arcs for now

  - Replace zoom and scroll with bounds array [ left, top, right, bottom ]
    - Change bounds in once place instead of several scroll and zoom calls
    - Adjust function to zoom, add functions to translate

  - Draw gray road lines before direction arrows
    - Maybe this will take care of intersections for us
    - We can add detail later with the lane markers

Parallel bezier curves may not be feasible
  - Seems like the gaps won't be uniform
  - Better to define one curve for the road, then offsets from the tangent for the lanes
  - Will need different distance tables per lane eventually

- Intersections of diagonal (but still perpendicular) lines
  - e.g. X instead of +
  - Make sure the back-offs, connections, etc still look right

- Intersections of non-perpendicular lines
  - Can we still get nice arcs for these? Or will they be all screwed up?

- Street defined by arc instead of line
  - Figure out lanes for this!

- Intersections involving arcs
  - Arc vs Line
  - Arc vs Arc


Someday might want to just do lots of short lines (e.g. from bezier curve), but I like the simplicity of lines and arcs for now

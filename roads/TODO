- Intersections of non-perpendicular lines
  - Can we still get nice arcs for these? Or will they be all screwed up?
  - Don't trim intersections as much if they aren't right angle
    - Make dependent on angle somehow

- Street defined by arc instead of line
  - Figure out lanes for this!

- Intersections involving arcs
  - Arc vs Line
  - Arc vs Arc

- Splitting and merging lanes
  - e.g. splitting to add a left turn lane

Someday might want to just do lots of short lines (e.g. from bezier curve), but I like the simplicity of lines and arcs for now

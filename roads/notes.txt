2/3:

Went down rabbit hole of trying to remove dangling joins, but there are situations where it is hard to know what should be removed. I think it's going to be better to leave the weird joins in and just draw a valid outline.

I started down this road yesterday with "failedLinks" that could be searched for while determining the outline path. I need similar information to links -- know when to exit the current route, what the next route is, and where to join it. I think that's enough...

Yesterday I had the wrong intersection (street intersection vs route intersection). I'll need to test when routes intersect twice and make sure I'm using the one closest to street intersection. Maybe I should build this into library code somewhere...

2/2:

Even when checking street length, I still get in the situation where arcs fit in one direction but are too big to fit in the other direction

I could prevent this by requiring longer roads (and seemed to with minimum length of 2), but I don't know how long is enough minimum.

It would be nice if I could just try to put arcs in every direction, and rescind the ones that aren't long enough. This gets me back to the problem of not knowing *why* a given arc failed. Is it because the startAngle was too long or the endAngle?
  - Is there a way to return this information from the arc generating function?
  - Can I look at which ones were successful?
    - If all 4 worked, we're good
    - If only 3 worked, it'll need to be a 3-way intersection. Focus on the street that has two working, and discard the rest
    - If only 2 worked...not sure. I'm having trouble creating a situation where only two work that isn't just a valid 3 way
    - So maybe just try to resolve the 3-worked case?

Can I make getBestJoinRadius tell me if it'll work? Since I'm testing what fits there anyway. Maybe give that a minimum and have it fail if nothing fits?

Seems like I should do this in two passes:
  1) Find the best radius for each quadrant
  1.5) Remove dangling quandrant
  2) Actually add pairs for appropriate quadrants

So would this be splitting up addPairs?

ALTERNATIVE:
  - Support hard intersections like this for drawing purposes
  - Nothing is necessarily wrong with the routes. This is navigatable. They just can't turn left.
  - The user will probably see this isn't what they want and change it. But we should be more robust in drawing it.
    - Could save a lot of effort trying to figure out which arcs are valid and which aren't
  - This is kind of like an intersection with a one-way road (we'll have the same problem there, right?)

We'd need to check for an intersection between streets, or maybe routes?
  - Everything with drawing a street deals with the outside routes, so just check those

Maybe have "nonlinks" (or better name) where I add routes that we were unable to connect with?
  - This could be used for drawing hard boundaries
  - Not sure if it ends up being useful for anything else, maybe something with intersections

NOW: Trying to create "failedLinks" that I can use for drawing
  - These are pretty close to normal links in terms of what they store
  - Trying to generate them in joinRoutes for now
    - Having some issues with getting proper intersection, need to make sure it's closest!

Actually, I don't like this alternative. I haven't implemented it to the point of working, but it feels like it would be cleaner to just not allow the dangling joins. I want to try splitting up the join work to find the radii and then remove the dangling join.

Trying to implement removal of dangling join. I'm worried this will be relative to my example and break if I move the lines around, though...also, it doesn't have enough info to resolve 2 opposing danglers. Might still want some sense of which streets are shortest to know what to exclude.

Never mind, this is dumb. There isn't enough information to know what to throw away in the dangling 3 case sometimes, either.
Probably best to just draw everything with the hard edge at let user adjust, since it's a monstrosity anyway.

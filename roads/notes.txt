2/2:

Even when checking street length, I still get in the situation where arcs fit in one direction but are too big to fit in the other direction

I could prevent this by requiring longer roads (and seemed to with minimum length of 2), but I don't know how long is enough minimum.

It would be nice if I could just try to put arcs in every direction, and rescind the ones that aren't long enough. This gets me back to the problem of not knowing *why* a given arc failed. Is it because the startAngle was too long or the endAngle?
  - Is there a way to return this information from the arc generating function?
  - Can I look at which ones were successful?
    - If all 4 worked, we're good
    - If only 3 worked, it'll need to be a 3-way intersection. Focus on the street that has two working, and discard the rest
    - If only 2 worked...not sure. I'm having trouble creating a situation where only two work that isn't just a valid 3 way
    - So maybe just try to resolve the 3-worked case?

Can I make getBestJoinRadius tell me if it'll work? Since I'm testing what fits there anyway. Maybe give that a minimum and have it fail if nothing fits?

Seems like I should do this in two passes:
  1) Find the best radius for each quadrant
  1.5) Remove dangling quandrant
  2) Actually add pairs for appropriate quadrants

So would this be splitting up addPairs?

ALTERNATIVE:
  - Support hard intersections like this for drawing purposes
  - Nothing is necessarily wrong with the routes. This is navigatable. They just can't turn left.
  - The user will probably see this isn't what they want and change it. But we should be more robust in drawing it.
    - Could save a lot of effort trying to figure out which arcs are valid and which aren't
  - This is kind of like an intersection with a one-way road (we'll have the same problem there, right?)

We'd need to check for an intersection between streets, or maybe routes?
  - Everything with drawing a street deals with the outside routes, so just check those

Maybe have "nonlinks" (or better name) where I add routes that we were unable to connect with?
  - This could be used for drawing hard boundaries
  - Not sure if it ends up being useful for anything else, maybe something with intersections

NOW: Trying to create "failedLinks" that I can use for drawing
  - These are pretty close to normal links in terms of what they store
  - Trying to generate them in joinRoutes for now
    - Having some issues with getting proper intersection, need to make sure it's closest!

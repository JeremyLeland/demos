- Splash screen when board is null
- Combined game state, including board and (maybe later) high scores
- Persist combined state. If board is null, show splash screen
  - Add helper function to Canvas for this? 
  - persistState( key, stateObject )
- Make playable basic Pipe Dream, branch it, put it on website
  - Then work on better version
  - More like the hacking in Bioshock
  - Make a maze of pipes, then rotate them all randomly
  - Instead of placing pipes from list, rotate them by clicking
  - I think this is more fun than basic Pipe Dream gameplay

1. Create a list of videos in order

find -name "*.mp4" | sort | sed -e "s/^/file '/" -e "s/$/'/" > list.txt

Run this command in Terminal in the "monday night" or "tuesday night" folder (I already ran it and included resulting list.txt)

2. Use ffmpeg to concatenate and reduce frame rate (time-lapse effect)

ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i list.txt -filter:v "setpts=0.01666*PTS" -an output.mp4

This made about a 6 minute video at 500 MB (in about 15 minutes on my desktop)
Going to try setpts of 0.01666 as well (should make one minute be one second)

Run this in the same folder as the list.txt (in the "monday night" or "tuesday night" folder)

Explanation:

    -f concat: Tells ffmpeg to concatenate files listed in list.txt.

    -safe 0: Allows use of absolute or relative paths.

    -filter:v "setpts=0.1*PTS": Speeds up the video by 10× (adjust 0.1 as needed).

    -an: Removes audio (optional, since time-lapses often don’t need sound).

    output.mp4: Your final combined, sped-up video.
